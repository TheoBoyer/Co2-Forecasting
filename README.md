# Co2-Forecasting
In this notebook, I'll use the data of Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii provided by the [Scripps CO2 Program](https://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/data/atmospheric_co2/primary_mlo_co2_record.html). The goal will be to explain the data using a model, and then try to predict the future concentration in atmosphere of co2 at this place until 2025.

You can either download the notebook and run it locally with jupyter or run it online on Kaggle by following [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/wolfy73/co2-evolution) and clicking the "fork" button
